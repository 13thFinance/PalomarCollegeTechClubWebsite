                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>So you want to learn how to become a hacker? Before you start, being a hacker is not as easy as you think it is. Firstly, to be a hacker you have to be an "innovator", a master of software and hardware. You have to be able to recognize vulnerabilities with ease and grace... but most importantly, you have to be able to make your own tools, your own software or hardware to exploit a new weakness. Being able to do that can take years of arduous effort and work, and until then you are a mere "cracker". A cracker is a l33t hax0r that has never made their own tools and hasn't gained the approval of a community of hackers. And thusly, you can only be taught to be a cracker, you cant be taught to be a hacker... but becoming a cracker is a first step...</p>

                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p>Before you can even become a cracker there is much to learn, see, and do. Here is a list of all the recommended skills you should have:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left:5%;padding:1%;">
                    <li>Know one programming language fairly decently</li>
                    <li>Learn basic terminal commands: Linux preferrably</li>
                    <li>Have a Linux distribution available</li>
                    <li>Have a good sense of humor</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Why must you know all this stuff? Let's start with the first item on the list. </p>
                <p style="padding-left:3%;padding-top:1%">
                    <strong>Why must I know programming?</strong> You must know programming because if you ever want to become a hacker youre going to have to write your own tools at one point or another. This means youre going to have to learn how to code, and almost as importantly, how to read code. You will spend a lot of time as a cracker using other people tools and going through program flow as well as maybe doing a little pseudocode yourself. Learning about your tools even at a conceptual level is a great boon to you and your allies, and if you know how to code and know how to read code you'll be 1000 years ahead of someone who doesn't. I strongly recommend clicking on our Learn Code tab in our navbar or checking out CodeCademy. It's a great way to start if you haven't yet.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:3%;padding-top:1%"><strong>Why must I know terminal Commands?</strong> You must know terminal commands simply because you'll have to learn them if you ever want to use any hacker tool. A huge chunk of tools come in Linux format, meaning: Command line gallore! Here is good resource to get you started if you havent already:</p>

                <p style="padding-left:3%;padding-top:1%"><strong>Why must I have a Linux Distribuition/OS/VM? </strong>As mentioned above, Many hacker tools can be found in linux distros. On top of learning  Linux commands you'll also be using them frequently, at least if youre actually trying to learn. It is possible to use Windows as a hacking station, or even OSX, but you will find your arsenal lacking from time to time as you try to look your programs to use. Or even find that you can't get proper access to something you want, or some other god-forsaken issue. Eitherway, Keep your Window OS for Games, but if youre serious about becoming a hacker, Linux is the way to go. Now then, which Linux to get? <strong>KALI LINUX!</strong> And never forget to do these commands after a fresh install of Linux: apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-get dist-upgrade, sudo reboot now, apt-get linux headers. It will save you much pain...Here is a Kali Linux installation guide.</p>

                <p style="padding-left:3%;padding-top:1%"><strong>So...Why MUST I Have A Sense of Humor?</strong> Cause you're f**cked without it. In all seriousness though, it is imperative that you have a sense of Humor. Tantamount. Critical. Etc... Socializing is a huge part of being a hacker, and that means getting along with them. If you're the antisocial type, don't worry there are a ton of guides for you to read through... but expect many of the ones written by actual hackers to be... "comedic" in a sense. If you ARE a somewhat likeable person and aren't disgrunted by directing your face at another human being(or texts) then expect to have a great time! Once you find a group to take you in... which may be hard at noob skill levels. In anycase once you find a group you'll be able to learn so much more than what articles can teach you. And to aid you in that process, here are some stuff you should know about:</p>
